# LLM-Vector-Database-Integration

In this personal research project, I focused on refining Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of vector databases. The core aim was to enhance the precision of LLM responses by incorporating vector databases, specifically Elasticsearch, in conjunction with OpenAI's advanced GPT-3.5-turbo-16k model.

The research involved experimenting with different data chunk sizes and segmenting pathology textbook data to create vectors stored in Elasticsearch. This innovative approach aimed to deliver more accurate and contextually relevant answers. The project effectively showcased the power of OpenAI's embedding techniques for transforming text into vectors and leveraged Elasticsearch for efficient data storage and retrieval.

To streamline the process, I utilized the LangChain framework, seamlessly blending OpenAI embeddings and Elasticsearch. LangChain facilitated document segmentation, storage, retrieval, and harnessed the capabilities of the GPT-3.5 model for answering document-related queries. This independent project highlights my proficiency in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to optimize language models for practical applications.
