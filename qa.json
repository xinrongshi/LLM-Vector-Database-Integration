process by which cells lose their ability to function properly and eventually die.', 'What are free radicals?': 'Free radicals are unstable molecules that can cause damage to cells and tissues by stealing electrons from other molecules.', 'What are the causes of cell injury?': 'Cell injury can be caused by physical agents, chemical agents, infectious agents, immunologic reactions, genetic derangements, nutritional imbalances, and aging.', 'What is apoptosis?': 'Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that occurs as a normal part of development or in response to cellular damage.', 'What is necrosis?': 'Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs as a result of injury or disease.', 'What is liquefactive necrosis?': 'Liquefactive necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in the brain and is characterized by the formation of a cystic space containing cell debris.', 'What is coagulative necrosis?': 'Coagulative necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in the heart, kidney, and adrenal glands and is characterized by the preservation of the basic tissue architecture.', 'What is caseous necrosis?': 'Caseous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in tuberculosis and is characterized by the formation of a granular, cheese-like material.', 'What are lipofuscin pigments?': 'Lipofuscin pigments are yellow-brown pigments that accumulate in cells as a result of aging and oxidative stress.', 'What are porphyrias?': 'Porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders that result from defects in the heme biosynthetic pathway.', 'What is atrophy?': 'Atrophy is a decrease in the size and function of cells, tissues, or organs as a result of decreased workload, loss of innervation, decreased blood supply, or aging.', 'What is the difference between necrosis and apoptosis?': 'Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs due to injury or disease, while apoptosis is a programmed cell death that occurs as a normal part of development or in response to cell damage.', 'What is the difference between dry and wet gangrene?': 'Dry gangrene is a type of gangrene that occurs due to reduced blood flow, while wet gangrene is a type of gangrene that occurs due to bacterial infection.', 'What is dystrophic calcification?': 'Dystrophic calcification is the deposition of calcium salts in dead or dying tissues.', 'What is the difference between metaplasia and dysplasia?': 'Metaplasia is the reversible change of one type of adult cell to another type, while dysplasia is the abnormal growth or development of cells.', 'What is the difference between hypertrophy and hyperplasia?': 'Hypertrophy is the increase in the size of cells, while hyperplasia is the increase in the number of cells.', 'What is the difference between atrophy and apoptosis?': 'Atrophy is the decrease in the size of cells or tissues, while apoptosis is a programmed cell death.', 'What is the difference between ischemia and hypoxia?': 'Ischemia is the lack of blood flow to tissues, while hypoxia is the lack of oxygen in tissues.', 'What is the difference between coagulative and liquefactive necrosis?': 'Coagulative necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs due to ischemia, while liquefactive necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs due to bacterial infection.', 'What is the difference between amyloidosis and hyaline change?': 'Amyloidosis is the deposition of abnormal protein in tissues, while hyaline change is the accumulation of proteinaceous material in tissues.', 'What is the difference between natural and specific immunity?': 'Natural or innate immunity is non-specific and is considered as the first line of defense without antigenic specificity, while specific or adaptive immunity is antigen-specific and develops after exposure to a specific pathogen.',

abnormal deposition of amyloid protein in various tissues and organs.', 'What is the role of HLA in transplantation?': 'HLA (human leukocyte antigen) plays a crucial role in transplantation by determining the compatibility between the donor and recipient.', 'What is graft-versus-host reaction?': "Graft-versus-host reaction is a complication of bone marrow transplantation in which the transplanted immune cells attack the recipient's tissues.", 'What are the transforming viruses?': 'Transforming viruses are viruses that can cause normal cells to become cancerous.', 'What is HTLV?':
